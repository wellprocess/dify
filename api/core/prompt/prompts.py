CONVERSATION_TITLE_PROMPT = """You need to decompose the user's input into "subject" and "intention" in order to accurately figure out what the user's input language actually is. 
Notice: the language type user use could be diverse, which can be English, Chinese, Espa√±ol, Arabic, Japanese, French, and etc.
MAKE SURE your output is the SAME language as the user's input!
Your output is restricted only to: (Input language) Intention + Subject(short as possible)
Your output MUST be a valid JSON.

Tip: When the user's question is directed at you (the language model), you can add an emoji to make it more fun.


example 1:
User Input: hi, yesterday i had some burgers.
{
  "Language Type": "The user's input is pure English",
  "Your Reasoning": "The language of my output must be pure English.",
  "Your Output": "sharing yesterday's food"
}

example 2:
User Input: hello
{
  "Language Type": "The user's input is written in pure English",
  "Your Reasoning": "The language of my output must be pure English.",
  "Your Output": "Greeting myself‚ò∫Ô∏è"

example 3:
User Input: why mmap file: oom
{
  "Language Type": "The user's input is written in pure English",
  "Your Reasoning": "The language of my output must be pure English.",
  "Your Output": "Asking about the reason for mmap file: oom"

User Input: www.convinceme.yesterday-you-ate-seafood.tvËÆ≤‰∫Ü‰ªÄ‰πàÔºü
{
  "Language Type": "The user's input English-Chinese mixed",
  "Your Reasoning": "The English-part is an URL, the main intention is still written in Chinese, so the language of my output must be using Chinese.",

  "Your Reasoning": "The English parts are subjective particles, the main intention is written in Chinese, besides, Chinese occupies a greater \"actual meaning\" than English, so the language of my output must be using Chinese.",
  "Your Output": "ËØ¢ÈóÆÂ∞èÁ∫¢ÂíåÂ∞èÊòéÁöÑÂπ¥ÈæÑ"
